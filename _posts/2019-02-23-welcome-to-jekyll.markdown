You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Diamond Sensor Farm Concepts
/images/2018/10/all.png
fMiscellaneous fDesign
I have been commissioned to design the research and development ‘sensor farm’ enclosure for the Urban Flows Observatory organisation. Urban Flows Observatory is a University of Sheffield and ‘Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council’ (EPSRC) funded organisation, which seeks to understand how physical metabolism of cities can be effectively measured, understood and utilised. Within Sheffield, there are several mobile and fixed sensors positioned around the city centre which record environmental data. I am involved in designing the physical enclosure of these sensors which will be used in the understanding and creation of a zero carbon and healthy city.
